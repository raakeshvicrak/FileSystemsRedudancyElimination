# FileSystemsRedundancyElimination
The project is about eliminating Redundancy in File System Using Data Compression and Secured File Sharing

To perform the duplicate check for some file, the user needs to get the file token from the private cloud server. 
The private cloud server will also check the user’s identity before issuing the corresponding file token to the user. 
The authorized duplicate check for this file can be performed by the user with the public cloud before uploading this file. 
Based on the results of duplicate check, the user either uploads this file or run PoW.

The Convergent encryption technique has been proposed to encrypt the data before outsourcing. To better protect data security, 
this project makes the first attempt to formally address the problem of authorized data de-duplication.


•	The private keys for privileges will not be issued to users directly, which will be kept and managed by the 
private cloud server. 
•	The users cannot share these private keys of privileges in this proposed construction, which means that it can 
prevent the privilege key sharing among users in the above straightforward construction. 
•	To get a file token, the user needs to send a request to the private cloud Server.
•	Extensive security and performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme is highly effective 
and resilient to malicious data modification attacks.
